Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

U
input= 1 string, 
output= integer, tracker of how many times "th" occurs within input string (case sensitive, so TH or Th, or tH doesn't count) 
must use recursion n 

p
-split string into list of char, 
- use find (return index)
-if index > -1  , add to tracker var, slice 
edge cases:
empty str:
returns 0
1 instance:
returns 1
multple:
returns occurences
backwards:

mixedcase: 

- use tracker , Add to tracker everytime "th" appears in list 
- Minus 
-once tracker = len(word) -1 return 
-base case: if
